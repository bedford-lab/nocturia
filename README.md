# nocturia
Nocturia, defined as waking at night to urinate, is a prevalent and burdensome condition with few effective treatments. While the primary risk factor for nocturia is advanced age, few preclinical studies have addressed the pathophysiological mechanisms of nocturia in older subjects. Here, we demonstrate disrupted diurnal regulation of urination in a novel translational model of nocturia, the aging mouse. Using a newly developed behavioral paradigm that enables circadian assessment of urination in group-housed mice, we discovered dampened diurnal regulation in aged animals compared to adult controls. Molecular analyses revealed disrupted diurnal expression of canonical circadian genes in aged mouse kidney and bladder tissues. Notably, we identified age-related loss of diurnal regulation of the bladder mechanosensory ion channel, Piezo1, suggesting a potential mechanism linking circadian disruption to altered bladder sensitivity. Our results reveal a role for circadian dysfunction in age-related nocturia and identify Piezo1 as a promising therapeutic target for chronobiological intervention.
